# Blender Render Queue (Batch Rendering)

Super simple Blender batch renderer which just generates scripts based off of the parameters you insert into main.py.

Built using Blender, ffmpeg, Python and Batch/Bash script

Made for my work, still a work in progress see todo.

### todo:
- automatic png sequence to video using ffmpeg
- make a ui/frontend using tauri
- get cameras in a scene automatically
- add more rendering options
- linux/macos support (don't own a device with either installed)
